# Project

Project is a place to create and train your chatbot, and to manage your chatbots once they are trained. It provides a central location to store all of your chatbot data, conversation transcripts, and feedback from users.

### Dashboard

The dashboard provides a weekly and monthly overview of conversation volume and user sentiment. Each project consumes chat credits from the organization, and if credits run out, the bot's behavior may change depending on the plan and you can track the usage of credits and storage used.

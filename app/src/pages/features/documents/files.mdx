Train multiple files from your file explorer. Your storage quota is based on the text content of the uploaded files, not the files themselves


### Sync Files
To sync existing files you have to delete your existing from the `documents` tab and add files again to train them on new content.

Let us know in the [Feature Requests](https://docsai.canny.io/featrue-requests) if you want to request a specific document type.

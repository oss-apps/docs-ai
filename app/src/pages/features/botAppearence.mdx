### Bot name and Questions
- The bot name will be displayed at the top of the chat box and used as the link preview title when you share your bot.

- While you can add as many questions as you want, 1 or 2 questions related to the most frequently asked questions will be looking good. Use `comma` seperated values for multiple questions.

- The initial question is used to greet and engage the user.

### Support Email

Each answer will have an **@** and **email** icon below it. Users can click the @ icon to copy the email address of the support team, or tap the email icon on mobile to open their default email app.
You can also add multiple `comma` seperated mails for users to copy or send mail to.

### Colors

You can customize your chatbot's icon and header with your brand color, and DocsAI will automatically select a contrasting text color.

### Feedback

Each answer will have a **thumbs up** and **thumbs down** icon below it. Users can upvote or downvote the answer to provide feedback, which will be visible in the chat history.

### Basics
Use project name and description to distinguish between multiple projects. The description will be used for SEO when you share links to your bot. 



### Custom system prompt
Advanced users can provide their own system prompts, but this should only be done with caution, as it can impact the bot's performance.
If you accidentally change the system prompts, simply click the `Reset` button to restore the default behavior.

### Generate Summary
Automated chat summaries are available on certain plans. They use chat credits, so be sure to check your plan limits before enabling them.

### FAQs

##### How to use DocsAI with Google Docs ?

There is no native support with google docs currently. You can export the document as `.docx` or `.pdf`
from docs and add here as file.

Let us know in the [Feature Requests](https://docsai.canny.io/featrue-requests) if you are looking for specific integration.

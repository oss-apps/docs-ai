###### What are messages?
Messages is a conversation between user and the bot. A conversation can have any number of messages.

###### What are credits and how are they calculated?
DocsAI credits are a unit of measurement that is used to track the usage of DocsAI services. Each time DocsAI generates an answer to a question or writes a piece of creative content, it consumes one credit. DocsAI conversations can also consume credits, depending on the plan you are on and whether or not you have enabled summaries for your conversations.
You can track your credit usage in the DocsAI Projects Dashboard.

###### What happens if I run out of credits?
If you run out of credits, you will continue to have access to unlimited text search depending upon the plan, but you will not be able to generate answers to questions. To continue generating answers, you can upgrade to a higher tier plan or contact us on hey@docsai.app for free credits if you are testing whether DocsAI works for you.
###### Are you using OpenAI and can I choose the model?
Yes, we are using OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model. You can't choose the model yet but we are working on adding support for it.

###### Which languages are supported by DocsAI?
DocsAI currently supports all languages supported by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, which is over 50. Some of the most commonly used languages include English, Spanish, French, Russian, and Japanese. You can test DocsAI with any language by uploading a document in that language. If DocsAI is able to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way, then it is working for you in that language.

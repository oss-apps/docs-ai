# Integrations

## Embed Chatbot on your website
First you need to install the SDK on you site. Use the following command
```sh
yarn add @docsai/chat-sdk 
```
or 

```sh
npm install @docsai/chat-sdk
```

Copy the project id from `Settings` tab and use it in the following code snippet.

```js
import { initDocsAI } from "@docsai/chat-sdk";

// Second argument will be the primary color of the chat widget
initDocsAI("<PROJECT_ID>", "#000");
```



## Slack
- In order to use the slack integration, go to `Settings` tab and click on `Add to Slack` button.
- You will be redirected to Slack's authorization page. You can install it to any of your Slack workspaces.
- Goto any channel and type `@docsAI <your_question_here>` and bot will reply with the answer.

## API
If you need any custom integration, you can use our chat API. You need the API key for that. You can get the API key from `Settings` tab. If the Key is not generated, click on `Generate` button and copy the key.

**Example**
```js

fetch('https://docsai.app/api/v1/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ projectId: '<project_id>', question: '<your_question>' }),
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <api_key>',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
})
```

# Welcome
 
DocsAI helps you in creating chatbot from your documents that you can embed in any websites.

## Create a organization
This will be your first step to create a chatbot. You will be asked to create an org when you login for the first time. An organisation can hold multiple projects and each project refers to a chatbot.

## Create a project
Once you created your organisation, you will be prompted to create a project. A project is a chatbot that you can embed in your website.

Choose a name for your project and click on create project. You will be redirected to the project dashboard.

# API Reference

If you need any custom integration, you can use our chat API. You need the API key for that. You can get the API key from `Settings` tab. If the Key is not generated, click on `Generate` button and copy the key.

<Callout type="warning">
Do not expose your **`API`** keys and **`tokens`** in the frontend. Instead, use a backend service to proxy your API calls. This will help to protect your credentials from attackers.

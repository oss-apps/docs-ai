     There are so many ways to embed a chatbot in your **React** website. We're going to use **`react-helmet`** in this sample.
     ```bash copy
     npm i react-helmet
      ```

    When using TypeScript, install type definitions.

      ```bash copy
      npm i --save-dev @types/react-helmet 
      ```      

    In your `app.jsx` or `app.tsx` file 

    ``` js copy
    import { Helmet } from "react-helmet"

    function App() {
      return (
        <>
          <Helmet>
            <script src="https://docsai.app/embed.min.js" project-id="<your_project_id>" async></script>
          </Helmet>
        </>
        )
    }  
    ```     
    React offers a variety of ways to add `<script>` tags to your website. [See alternate methods here.](https://dev.to/collegewap/how-to-add-script-tag-to-reactjsx-2888)

## Wordpress

Using a wordpress plugin we can easily embed a chat bot in your wordpress site. Learn how to add [JS Plugin](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/how-to-properly-add-javascript-to-wordpress-3-top-methods/).
In this we're going to use [WPCode](https://wordpress.com/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers) plugin.

- Install and activate the free plugin on your site.
- Go to Code Snippets → + Add Snippet in your WP Admin.
- Hover over the option to Add Your Custom Code (New Snippet) and choose Use Snippet.
- Add a title to help you remember what the snippet does. You’re the only person who will see this.
-  Set the Code Type equal to JavaScript Snippet.
- Add the below code for your snippet to the Code Preview. The plugin will automatically add the opening and closing `<script>` tags so you don’t need to include that portion of the JavaScript snippet.
- The most important options here are the Insertion settings. You can add your snippet sitewide to the header, footer, or body. For important snippets, you should choose the header, though the footer is slightly better from a performance perspective.

For [visual references](https://wordpress.com/go/website-building/how-to-properly-add-javascript-to-wordpress-3-top-methods/)  use docs from official website.

```html copy
<script src="https://docsai.app/embed.min.js" project-id="<your_project_id>" async></script>
```

## Integrators
We support other website builders, such as **Webflow**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace**, which allow you to insert the `<script>` tag.

## Troubleshooting 

**I don't see any chat bot widget in my website**

If you are seeing this error, it means that the `<script>` tag is not loading on your website. Please check the HTML source code to ensure that the tag is correct.


**I see blue chatbot widget in my website and it says 404 project not found**

This means the `project-id` is incorrect. Make sure you get the valid `project-id` from your settings.
